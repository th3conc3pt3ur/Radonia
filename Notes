Issues:
	1 - NPCs and Monsters don't scroll with the map (game.cpp:scroll)
	2 - Monsters can move out of the map (sprite.h:102/103)
	3 - NPCs and Monsters can move over non passable tiles (sprite.cpp:201)
	4 - Monsters don't go back correctly when they're hurt (player.cpp:280)
	5 - Monsters' textures bug when they're hurt (sprite.cpp:214)
	6 - Sword animation is quite strange (player.cpp:sword)
	7 - Sometimes, NPCs, monsters, or both, don't spawn (???)
